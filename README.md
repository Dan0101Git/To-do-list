Tasky - A Modern To-Do List Application
A feature-rich, single-page to-do application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project, part of The Odin Project curriculum, focuses on solid architectural patterns and robust state management without relying on any front-end frameworks.

Live Demo: https://dan0101git.github.io/To-do-list/

Features
✅ Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for both projects and tasks.

✅ Seamless inline editing for a smooth user experience (no disruptive pop-ups).

✅ Persistent state using localStorage to save your work between sessions.

✅ Clean, multi-project card layout for managing different contexts.

✅ A robust sidebar with different views (My Tasks, Starred) and project filtering.

✅ Automatic sorting of completed tasks to the end of the list.

Challenges & Lessons Learned
The primary challenge of this project was managing the application state and keeping the UI perfectly in sync using only vanilla JavaScript. Implementing complex UI features like inline editing required a deep understanding of DOM manipulation, event delegation, and handling numerous edge cases. This project serves as a testament to the power of vanilla JS but also highlights the problems that modern frameworks like React are designed to solve.

Future Plans (Version 2.0)
While the current version is a complete and polished product, future plans include:

Subtasks: Full UI support for creating and managing nested subtasks.

Drag & Drop: The ability to reorder project cards and move tasks between them.

Activity Calendar: A GitHub-style contribution graph to visualize daily productivity.
